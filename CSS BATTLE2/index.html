      <h1>We take pride in setting the lowest customer expectations.</h1>
      <h4>We don’t promise excellence, because lying is bad (and exhausting).
Instead, we promise something far more authentic: pure, unfiltered mediocrity.
Our products will test your patience, your faith, and possibly your warranty.
We may not fix your problems, but we’ll definitely create new ones to keep you entertained.
Choose us — because suffering builds community.</h4>

        <p>The product didn’t work, but at least it looked confused trying to. Customer service told me to ‘believe in myself.’ Wouldn’t recommend, but can’t stop laughing.</p>

        <p>Arrived late, broke early, and ignored my emails. Exactly the kind of chaos I paid for. Five stars for emotional turbulence.</p>

        <p>It stopped working before I finished unboxing. Truly ahead of its time — in failure. Would buy again just to feel something.</p>
